REQUIREMENTS
------------

Currently, psh2 should work on any modern Unix system with perl5. It has been
most extensively tested on GNU/Linux systems with perl 5.6/5.8.

Requires Perl Modules:
- POSIX, Getopt::Std, Pod::Text
- Term::ReadLine::Gnu for the readline frontend
or Term::EditLine for the editline frontend

Optional and recommended Perl Modules:
- Locale::gettext for localization
- Test::More for the tests in t/

INSTALLING psh2
---------------

Follow the standard procedure (from the source directory):
	perl Makefile.PL
	make

As superuser (if required):
	make install

WITHOUT root ACCESS
-------------------

If you don't have root access you'll have to move the files manually. You
can make your own modules directory and put something like alias
perl="perl -I~/.pm" in your shell's startup dotfile, and copy the modules
there. Then copy psh wherever you want it, such as ~/bin.


MAKING psh YOUR LOGIN SHELL
---------------------------

If you'd like to make psh your login shell, you'll need to change your
entry in /etc/passwd. Here's an example for a Linux distribution with
bash:
	chsh -s `which psh`
Depending on your setup, you may need to add the full path to psh to
another file, such as /etc/shells.

It's possible that if you don't have root access, your Unix flavor won't
allow you to change your login shell. You can try to work around this by
putting something like
	exec psh
in your shell's startup dotfile. Be careful that this file isn't executed
by a shebang (#!) invocation of the shell, or shell scripts written for
that shell may mysteriously fail.
