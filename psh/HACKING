Make sure you have SSH 1.x installed (even if you already have 2.x installed).

Run ssh-keygen to generate SSH1 key.

Add:

    foo$ export CVS_RSH=ssh1
    foo$ export CVSROOT=sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/psh

to .bashrc (if using bash, or the equivalent if using another shell).
Substitute your Source Forge user id for sfuser.

    foo$ cvs checkout 
    Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Host 'cvs.psh.sourceforge.net' added to the list of known hosts.
    sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net's password: 
    cvs server: Updating psh
    U psh/.cvsignore
    ...
    foo$

When prompted, agree to connect, and use your Source Forge password.

Go into the psh directory and do cvs upd -dP to prune the directories that
we are not currently using.

    foo$ cd psh
    foo$ cvs upd -dP
