These are instructions for using a SourceForge
(http://www.sourceforge.net/) developer account to update psh with CVS. If
you aren't a psh developer (that is, you don't have commit access to the
CVS repository), you can follow the instructions on the SourceForge CVS
page for anonymous access.

Make sure you have ssh 1.x installed (even if you already have 2.x 
installed).

Run ssh-keygen to generate SSH1 key.

Add:

	foo$ export CVS_RSH=ssh1
	foo$ export CVSROOT=sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/psh

to .bashrc (if using bash, or the equivalent if using another shell).
Substitute your SourceForge user id (in all lowercase) for sfuser.

	foo$ cvs checkout 
	Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
	Host 'cvs.psh.sourceforge.net' added to the list of known hosts.
	sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net's password: 
	cvs server: Updating psh
	U psh/.cvsignore
	...

When prompted, agree to connect, and use your SourceForge password.

Go into the psh directory and do cvs upd -dP to prune the directories that
we are not currently using.

	foo$ cd psh
	foo$ cvs upd -dP
	sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net's password: 

After you've edited a file, built and tested psh, then:

	foo$ cvs commit -m 'Fixed minor tpyos' HACKING
	sfuser@cvs.psh.sourceforge.net's password: 
	Checking in HACKING;
	/cvsroot/psh/psh/HACKING,v <-- HACKING
	new revision: 1.3; previous revision: 1.2
	done
