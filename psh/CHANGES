New Features:
 * Saving the history file now respects $Psh::history_size if
   Term::ReadLine::Perl is used
 * Misc new features for pipeline code, e.g. try:
     ls | s/a/b/
   (runs replacement over output of previous program and prints it)
     or
     ls | { print $_; }q
   ( runs the code in braces in an iteration over each line of
     the output unmodified)
     or
     netstat | { $_[1]>2; }g
   ( runs ins "grep" mode - line will only be printed if expression
     evaluates to true. @_ is set to the line split with \s+,
	 $_ is the line)
   
   HELP - could anybody else document this as I've got no clue
   where this fits in in psh.pod ?!?
