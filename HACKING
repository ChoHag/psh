Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core developers use GitHub to coordinate their work. The official version
lives at https://github.com/gnp/psh. Anyone can clone the code from their to
their local machine and make local changes but only the core developers can
push their local commits back up to that GitHub project. However, anyone can
can create a GitHub account, and anyone with a GitHub account can fork a copy
of the project into their own user account, and then they can clone that copy
to their local machine and the commits they make to that can be pushed back up
to their fork on GitHub. People who do this are able to make a "pull request"
asking for specific changes in their fork to be considered for merging into
the official version, all within the GitHub web site.

Requests for core developer status should be directed to the project
administrator, Gregor N. Purdy, Sr. (gnp@acm.org). We keep the number of core
developers low, but occasionally slots will open up. People who have submitted
useful and high quality pull requests in the past will be given priority for
membership in the project.

GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a GitHub account is quick, easy and free. Just go to their web site at
https://github.com/signup/free. You can upgrade a free account to a paid
account in future if you decide you want some of the paid account features.

GitHub has great help on getting started with git as well as with their
service.

Welcome
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the wonderful world of Perl Shell hacking. We look forward to your
contributions.

Here are some things to keep in mind while hacking:

  * Please write good commit messages. Some more specific advice is available
    here: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

  * Please write test programs in the t/ directory whenever you can. The better
    we make this test suite, the higher the quality of our releases.

  * Please make high level notes in the CHANGES.pod file, because these are
    edited to make the final CHANGES.pod when we make releases.

  * After you've made some major contributions, you may want to create an
    entry for yourself in the psh.pod file's CONTRIBUTORS section.
