{"name":"Perl Shell (psh)","body":"Perl Shell (psh) combines aspects of `bash` and other shells with the power\r\nof Perl scripting. Some of its features:\r\n\r\n* Globbing: `grep foo lib/**/*.pm`\r\n* Redirects, including to file handles: `command >[=FOO]`\r\n* Inline filters: `ls | { print ++$i, \": $_\"; }q` (adds line numbers)\r\n* Inline grep filters: `netstat | { $_[1]>2; }g`\r\n* Inline substitution filters: `ls | s/y/k/`\r\n* ... and more\r\n\r\n## Genesis\r\n\r\nNumerous times when developing Perl code, I (Gregor) wished for an interactive\r\nPerl execution environment in which to try out code snippets. After some\r\nlooking around, I didn't see a handy solution that acted enough\r\nlike a shell to be satisfactory. It all might have ended (or rather not begun)\r\nhere except that while discussing the idea at lunch with my friend Denny Dahl\r\nthe pressure finally became too much to bear. That evening, version 0.001 of\r\nthe Perl Shell was born.\r\n\r\nInitially Perl Shell development was privately hosted, with low-tech manual\r\nmailing lists. Soon that became too unwieldy so I moved the project\r\nto [Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/psh/) where they provided\r\na CVS repository (now Subversion), a release archive, mailing list management and more. Years\r\nlater in 2010 I moved the project to [GitHub](https://github.com/), although\r\nthe mailing lists [are still hosted at Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=475).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThe original version was written by Gregor N. Purdy, Sr. but now there have\r\nbeen numerous contributors, and much of the more advanced functionality was\r\nactually implemented by members of the Perl Shell Core Team (see the file\r\n`psh.pod`, or the manpage for `psh` if you've installed Perl Shell for more\r\ninformation).\r\n","tagline":"Aspiring to be your primary login shell","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
