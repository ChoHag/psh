Projects to be done:

- Proper TAB completion
The API for communication between the Completor object and the frontends has been set. The new ABI does not restrict us to the readline-pecularities, so we can add advanced completion features: optional case insensitive completion for filenames, automatic typo correction etc.

- History support to Psh2.pm
History has to be handled by Psh2.pm and not by the frontends. Some people also really like to use the ! history expansion features, so we optionally have to offer them.

- Prompts
We need prompt support. Later on we can add the psh1 "theme" system.

- Support for ROX Packages and Mac OS X/Gnustep .app executables


Loose-Ideas:
- >{} and <{} redirects
- Auto-directory-changing
- Error Correction
