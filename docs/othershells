OTHER SHELLS WRITTEN IN PERL

Larry Walls' Perl Shell

Larry Wall exhibits the simple Perl shell while (<>) { eval; print $@; } on
page 161 of the Camel Book (2nd Edition).

lpsh

Lee Eakin <leakin@dfw.nostrum.com> has written the Fancy Poor Man's Perl SHell
(called lpsh for Lee's Perl Shell), a simple Perl shell that he has used for
a number of years now (it is derived from Larry Wall's Perl Shell). 
He has added some numeric conversion functions because he often uses it as a
calculator.

He has placed it on the web at <http://www.dfw.nostrum.com/~leakin/psh>
(for the code) and <http://www.dfw.nostrum.com/~leakin/psh.README> for a
short explanation of the code and a reference to the main Perl Shell site.

Perl Debugger Shell

Rich Graves <rcgraves@brandeis.edu> posted a comment to the original
psh-0.001 announcement on <http://freshmeat.net>, which contained this
gem that leverages the Perl debugger: perl -d -e 1;

perlsh

Hiroo Hayashi <hiroo.hayashi@computer.org> includes perlsh, a 
``one-line perl evaluator with line editing function and variable name
completion function'' as an example with his Term::ReadLine::Gnu Perl module.

PSH.pm

In an example of convergent evolution, at <http://jenda.krynicky.cz/>
there is a Perl shell module called PSH.pm. It is designed to provide
a command line that can be called inside some other program via 
PSH::prompt();, but a small file psh.pl is also included that uses PSH
to provide a standalone shell.

SoftList

Some versions of the Perl faq mention an interactive Perl shell called
SoftList, which can still be found at
<http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/perl/SoftList/>. It predates
Term::Readline and was apparently last touched in 1993, so it seems to
be obsolescent.


timtosh

Tim Newsome, <nuisance@cmu.edu>, has developed a shell he calls
timtosh (There Is More Than One SHell). Per his web site
(<http://www.wiw.org/~drz/timtosh>), it is a shell written entirely in
Perl. The goal is to get a shell which you can extend in Perl and can do
some other niceties related to Perl (like perl re file matching). As o
 1999-12-13 (Perl Shell 0.004 release date), Tim says B<timtosh> ``is
focused quite differently than B<psh> is, but is currently
still waiting for a rewrite of the command line parsing.
(It has been for almost a year now)''.


vbsh

Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington's book B<Perl Cookbook>, published by
O'Reilly in 1998 (ISBN 1-56592-243-3) has "Example 15-4. vbsh" on page 531 for
section 15.11 (Editing Input). It stands for Very Bad SHell.

Zoidberg

Jaap Karssenberg and Raoul Zwart actively develop a modular perl shell called
B<Zoidberg>, available at C<http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net/>.
